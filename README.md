Tradle
======

Tradle's vision is an emergent global Tradenet, based on bitcoin,Â where trade programming of the planet's digitized assets is done by you, and trade fairness and compliance can be assured without goverment.

What Tradenet will do
======================
Bitcoin opened new ways of exchanging value. We believe this breakthrough will transform the trade globally. If algorithmic trading on capital markets is any indication, all trade activity will become automated. This will include trade of physical goods and their digitized representations. It will include and transform existing trade activities like agreements, orders of goods and services, logistics and warehousing, production and quality control, time control and project management, invoices and payments. Tradenet will use freely exchangeable digital tokens/coins to create new incentive systems and new forms of corporate structures.

Motivation
==========

Internet was born decentralized, but most all financially successful sites have grown into monopolies. The dire consequences of this centralization have come into focus with [the theft of 100M credit cards from Target in 2013](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/19/target-breach-credit-card-accounts) and became unberable after we learned of [mass surveilance and government hacking into all aspects of our lives](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/3/17/snowden_docs_expose_how_the_nsa). In bitcoin world, whenever a centralized solution emerged on top of a decentralized blockchain, it immediately [attracted the hackers](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/02/having-lost-463-million-in-bitcoins-mtgox-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/) and [regulators](http://cointelegraph.com/news/112034/mitigating-the-legal-risks-of-issuing-securities-on-a-cryptoledger). In our current finance system [systemic abuse of trust became a norm](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/l/london_interbank_offered_rate_libor/index.html). Just note the multibillion dollar fines that banks were hit with in 2014 for deceptive activities that led to the US and global financial meltdown. 

We need a technology that is decentralized and can operate in a fashion which requires no trust in operators. Blockchain is a technology breakthrough that was born out of 20 years of research into such trustless systems. Its open ledger has inspired thousands of bright minds and hundreds of startups to dare to rethink the very structures of our economy and democracy. A new technology stack is forming around the blockchain, with the ability to represent a world with digitized assets, creating a foundation for global programmable trade. Programmable trade will greatly reduce the amount of delegation of personal powers to the intermediaries.

But we have to be careful. As [software is eating the world](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460) we increasingly begin to trust a new representative, this time a developer. To avoid creating a new subtle layer of trust and retain our personal power, we must be able to program the key aspects of the trade ourselves. Tradle will make it possible to express complex trade rules in a simple way.

Backstory 
=========
The idea of programmable tradle is new, but a more general idea of programmable web has been around since at least 1998, when Tim Berners Lee published his book Weaving The web. We have seen the spikes of excitement around mashable sites, Facebook platform and declared the age of the APIs to arrive, at least 5 times over. The achievements of RESTful methodology notwithstanding, the key ingredient of programmable Web is still eluding us. The greatest last push to add this ingredient was the Semantic Web initiative of Tim Berners Lee at W3C. 

My friends and I have been so fascinated with the promise of Semantic Web that in the early 2000s we left our lucrative corporate jobs and have for over a decade been building systems that operated on a core principle "Web for humans and machines". In any of the dozens of applications we built, anything that user could see and do in the application, could be equally accessed and modified by the programs via a single data-centric bi-directional Web API (in fact UI was built on top of that API). This is in contrast to sites and apps that are built just for humans, with may be a bolt-on, often read-only API later on, and the systems that are built just for machines, like EDI and XML exchanges in the past and Web API-based services lately.

We have built complex value chain management systems with independent companies coordinating their trading activity across 20+ countries via decentralized network of corporate web databases. This included ordering of millions of tons of products, tracking multi-modal transportation across continents and organizing invoicing and payments, without a centralized system, while creating a unified trading information field, where each participant could see everything he needed, but only pertaining to the business activities in which his company took part. 

There was one problem though. It was really hard to sell this system to businesses, because it required their trust in us, an intermediary that would build and maintain those decentralized Web databases, ensure the quality and especially the security of their sensitive business data. Once this trust was finally given all went very smoothly, but sales process was long and expensive.

Bitcoin changes the game. A trustless (no trust allocation needed) bitcoin technology allows to build such trading system on a new foundation. Like the Web before it forced a rewrite of a most of the business software, bitcoin, or rather a tradenet will force that rewrite again. Those who do believe it, can look at ASPs, that were trying to run old software on the Web, replaced by SaaS systems that provided similar functions in a new environment.

Priciples of the Tradenet
=========================

* Decentralized, based on blockchain, or rather sidechains and treechains
* Open-source
* Using an appcoin as payment for services, such as development, network security, computations, storage, analytics, etc. etc.
* Equally accessible by Humans and Machines
* Open for inspection by third-parties (investors, business participants, researchers, tax collectors), reducing the need for governments to prosecute in order to protect the public interest
* Programmable by you, eliminating the need to trust developers to translate your business rules and agreements into software


Introduction
============

I have been fascinated with the concept of Tradenet since I first heard it from [Cameron Gray](http://about.me/cameron.john.gray) in his [Bitcoin Magazine article](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/15021/sovereignty-2-0/). Cameron defines Tradenet as "quantify anything of value so that it can be traded in a decentralized highly competitive frictionless market". His vision somehow reminded me of traders from [Vernor Vinge's Deepness In the Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky), who used open information as a basis for a galactic trade. I would define Tradenet as an open ledger world commerce. Below I am trying to imagine the tenets of the Tradenet to be.

* Algo-trading. In the past decade most capital markets became fully electronic (new bitcoin markets were born electronic from the get go). This opened the doors to an algorithmic trading revolution. Top Wall Street firms trade 100% algorithmically, yet individuals and smaller firms are largely behind. Trading hours are 24/7 in currency and the emerged crypto-currency markets. Amount of assets traded is skyrocketing. Algorithmic trading helps human beings navigate this expanding sea.

* Smart contracts. The biggest excitement in bitcoin world is centered around the notion of programmability of money,  with the key concepts being smart contracts and smart properties. A highly hyped new blockchain Ethereum, even has a built-in ability to execute smart contracts, contracts that have funds associated with them, arbitrary code and state. Ethereum's limitation though is that its contracts can not access data from the outside world. Algo-trading is a form of a smart contract that uses outside data called market indicators to make financial decisions.

* Smart data. For decentralized financial applications to bridge the blockchain and the Web, Web sites must become more accessible to the machines. We are tapping into our decade-long research into Semantic Web to build such a bridge, to make data smart. Algo-trading is our first app for the emerging Tradenet. As data become smart, a lot of new smart things become possible, like a thermostat negotiating electricity rates with the energy network, a car negotiating the price with the nearby garages, a Legal Will executed without a lawyer. We define the rules, and machines negotiate and exchange resources on our behalf to get things we need to live in this world.

* We define the rules. The language that defines our business agreements became so dense and specialized that we now can not read without intermediaries. It has become the [biggest lie on the Web](https://tosdr.org/) to click 'I agree' on Terms of Service and License agreements. This lack of understanding often puts us at the mercy of lawyers and government officials. Smart contracts promise to free us from this dependency, but if people can not define the rules themselves, they will just replace one set of intermediaries - lawyers, with another - developers. A great web site [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) gave non-developers a way to program the Social Web. Tradle visual contract maker inspired by IFTTT allows anyone to create trading algorithms and we are extending it to cover other types of smart contracts. 


Problem space
=============

According to bitcoin core developer Gavin Andersen off-chain data and computations is the next bitcoin frontier:  ["all of the really interesting complex contracts I can think of require data from outside the blockchain"](http://gavintech.blogspot.com/2014/06/bit-thereum.html)

Ethereum captured people's imagination on the potential of extended on-chain computations with a crowdsale that is approaching cool $30M. Ethereum's innovations such as per-contract storage, arbitrary scripts, pay forward computations (gas), etc. allow to implement a whole new class of apps. Yet, there is a much larger class of apps that will emerge between the web/cloud and the chain.

In bitcoin world these apps are traditionally called Oracles. Vitalik in [Ethereum and Oracles](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/ethereum-and-oracles/) blog writes: "The most common case that will appear in reality is the case of external data".

There has been a lot of discussions on oracles but only recently several companies released the implementations: Ripple's Codius.org, Orisi, RealityKeys, etc. (Codius whitepaper refers to several more oracles systems).

Each more or less focuses on one specific aspect of oracles functionality:

* sandoxing: this technique protects host machine, e.g. a miner, from untrusted and possibly mishbehaving contracts. Ripple's new [Codius.org](http://codius.org) uses NaCl - google native client. A Rackspace-sponsored [ZeroVM](http://www.zerovm.org/), an offshoot of the NaCl project, could be used instead. Both ZeroVM and NaCl provide deterministic environment to ensure that repeated compputations achieve identical results. This comes at a price, as some things are intentionally blocked in this environment, like access to the outside world. Another, much more more flexible, sandboxing solution [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) has recently become very popular, but it only provides deterministic deployment, not execution. In addition, both NaCl and Docker sandboxes can run inside a full Virtual Machine, like VirtualBox to fully isolate host machine from possibly misbehaving smart contracts.

* proof of untempered execution:  Sandboxing protects the host, but the opposite is needed too. In decentralized environment, hosting of apps is done by the untrusted parties. This is in contrast to current cloud settings, where we implicitly trusted Amazon, Google and Microsoft, etc. In post-Snowden era we know that this trust was misplaced. So, in building a new distributed cloud, especially the one integrated with a bitcoin financial network we must trust nothing, and rely on cryptographic proofs of data immutability, code immutability, and computation verifiability, applying zero knowledge systems pervasively. A recently invented technique called [zk-SNARKS](http://www.scipr-lab.org/) allows something that is hard to imagine, verify computations without repeating them.

* secure external data: Trusty URIs (hash-URIs), Notary Chains, proofofexistence.com and Reality Keys tackle the question whether we can trust website's data. Hash-URIs of all the data inputs (including hash-URIs of all dependencies) combined with hash-URI of the code can provide verifiability of public computations. Any other network node may do the audit, by performing the same computations and verifying the resulting hash-URI. Great for open source code and fully open data. If some private inputs (like secret keys, must be included, then zk-SNARKS technique must be used.

* communicating decisions to the chain: Today there are a multitude of solutions based on multisig, split secret, etc. The most promising is Adam Back & Austin Hill's new sidechains startup called Blockstream which will allow oracles to run as nodes in a sidechain, with direct integration into the bitcoin mainchain.

* consensus between oracles: Orisi uses M of N multi-sig to work around the possibly compromised or unavailable oracles. This replaces "everyone agrees" notion of the blockchain with the "some agree". May be with the Adam Back's sidechains this compromise can be avoided.

* user choosing oracle nodes: this is Codius's approach to securing computations by relying on each node's reputation.

* rendezvous and communication. Oracles need to discover each other, users need to be able to discover oracles. A mix of techniques used by bitcoin nodes, like DNS seeds, broadcasting known nodes, etc., can be employed.

Tradle will use mechinisms above and add two innovations to make smart contracts simple:

* a) non-developer (DIY) contracts. Simple rule based UI designed to be used on mobiles, so that no developer is needed as an intermediary to make and read contracts. The complexity of programming is moved to data and a growing number of functions defined on data.
* b) data unification. We use a visual data modeling framework and a data mapping engine, developed over the last decade, to make web data accessible to smart contracts.


Tradenet: oracle and data nodes 
============================================================

Tradle app compiles a tradle into A JavaScript code, which is executed by the oracle. Oracle subscribes to events from data nodes and when they arrive, it passes the inputs to the tradle code. This way tradle code can be simple and verifiable.

* Subscription. Specifically, oracle reads tradle definition and sends tradle URI as a subscription request to the Data node, and waits for the events on websockets. A tradle may have several input indicators, so oracle will get subscribed to several event types. To compensate for reboots and re-connections in a subscription request oracle says: give me new 'if-modified since' for each tradle indicator.

* Verification. Data Server publishes every event with hash-URI and sends it to Notary Chains. Oracle verifies each event's data URI with the Notary Chains. 

* Synchronization. Each Data node may provide different indicators. Indicator URI reflects the node it is coming from, e.g. http://server1.tradle.io. Thus oracle may send a subscription to several data nodes (if all indicators are on the same server, it sends one request with 3 indicators in it). Events in each indicator come at a different time. Oracle saves retrieved indicators into its local database. This way when any event arrives oracle can call tradle code with all the values of other indicators it saved before.

Tradenet: oracle and blockchain
===============================

Each tradle has a trade, which defines what assets to trade, in what quantities and at what prices. JavaScript tradle code does not have access to this information. Neither does oracle. Oracle tells user's wallet to execute a trade. Wallet has all the keys to access user accounts and sign transactions.

Examples
========
Some early applications of Tradenet will be:

* supply chain management, order management, logistics
* accounting
* smart contracts, most talked about application now in bitcoin community
* algorithmic trading
* energy usage and trade: smart thermostat, solar panels
* share-a-ride and other resource share schemes, especially with dynamic pricing

Future areas:

* securitization of everything, your back yard, your roof, etc.
* discovering e-commerce opportunities - auto-comparative shopping
* e-commerce syndication (after market integration into e-commerce site)
* automatic auctions: between car and the garages
