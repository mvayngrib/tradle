decentralized automatic trading of traditional and crypto assets, a form of a TradeNet

Introduction
============

* Algo-trading. Algorithmic trading traditionally has allowed traders to discover market inefficiencies and profit from them. In the past decade most traditional markets have become fully electronic, while the new bitcoin market was born electronic. This opened the doors to an algorithmic trading revolution. Top Wall Street firms trade 100% algorithmically, yet individuals and smaller firms are largely behind. Trading hours are 24/7 in currency and the emerged crypto-currency markets. Amount of assets traded is skyrocketing. Algo-trading helps human beings navigate this expanding sea. 

* Decentralized stack. Web was born decentralized, but most all financially successful sites have grown into monopolies. The dangers of centralized solution have come into focus after Snowden's revelations. In bitcoin world, whenever a centralized solution emerged on top of a decentralized blockchain, it immediately attracted hackers and regulators. Blockchain is a technology breakthrough that was born out of 20 years of research into decentralized systems. Recently it has inspired thousands of bright minds and hundreds of startups to switch to the decentralized world. A new technology stack is forming around the blockchain, an alternative to today's cloud-based multi-tier solutions.

* Smart contracts. The biggest excitement in bitcoin world is centered around the notion of programmability of money,  with the key concepts being smart contracts and smart properties. A highly hyped new blockchain Ethereum, even has a built-in ability to execute smart contracts. Ethereum's limiation though is that its contracts can not access data from the outside world. Algo-trading is a form of a smart contract that uses outside data called market indicators to make financial decisions.

* Smart data. Algo-trading is the first application of a new technology stack. It is a stack  for decentralized financial applications that bridges the blockchain and the Web. For that to work, Web sites must be accessible by machines. We are tapping into our decade-long research into Semantic Web to build such a bridge, to make data smart. Algo-trading is the first step in the emerging TradeNet. As data become smart, a lot of new smart things will become possible, like a thermostat negotiating electricity rates with the energy network, a car negotiating the price with the nearby garages.
